## ARToolKit implementation in Ionic WebApp

### With Heroku deployment

To install dependecies after cloning

```bash
$ npm install
```

## DOM Manipulation from services(although I am passing dom manipulators from components), do not imitate this :)

Then, to run it, cd into `new-ts-arkit` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add browser
$ ionic cordova serve
```
